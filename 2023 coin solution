1037990 42488 - middle codes

- .... .-. . . = THREE in morse code

DDYASDTS TE YEEYIIEB EGE NE H E,NRHWS,TE R H EV LUUREAO THATK - cipher text 1

URL = the symbols at the bottom

if you use rail fence cipher on the cipher text 1 with the code THREE you get:

divide by leagues under the sea, north west, they are the key = 20000 leagues under the sea movie

if you divide the middle codes by 20000 you get 51.8995 2.1244 which are long lat codes

northwest of the location is government office GCHQ

now plug that into a viginere cipher and you get the flag:
