WMHD35RA3NIDSXTOHR3MTA0YUHCEALNP - the outside

the symbols mean templar cipher

use templar cipher to decode the inside text which gives TRY EVERY OTHER

using the clue you can get MD5 AND XOR MAY HELP, WH3R3 IS TH3 T0UC4N, H3R3 IS TH3 T0UC4N

encrypt WH3R3 IS TH3 T0UC4N with md5 to get 03f02e0c9b481c0b3da139a005fb4bc2



flag = PECAN4WASGR8
